# Bug Bounty Helper Tool

## Overview
This project is a Python-based productivity tool designed to help bug bounty hunters identify potential attack surfaces by filtering URLs that contain input parameters.

## What the Tool Does
- Reads a list of URLs
- Identifies URLs with query parameters
- Extracts potential attack points
- Reduces noise during reconnaissance

## Why This Matters
Not all endpoints are equally valuable.  
Effective bug bounty hunting focuses on input points where user-controlled data is processed.

## Security Concepts Demonstrated
- Attack surface identification
- Input validation awareness
- Web application reconnaissance

## Technologies Used
- Python
- urllib.parse
- Linux terminal

## Example Use Case
- Bug bounty reconnaissance
- Web penetration testing
- Target prioritization

## Disclaimer
This tool is intended for ethical and authorized security research only.
